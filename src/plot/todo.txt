TODO:
* make some documentation and add hints to all controls (especially experiment
control)
* clean the code of the time-to-double transformation (when parsing raw ascii
data)
* add a separate window for data analysis (with constant zoom and data, with
selectable points and appropriate buttons to calculate TEC from frequency
measurements)
* try to fix a bug with a view zooming (by selecting an area). After zooming in
with xBottom and yRight axes plot still uses autoscale for the yRight axis.
* allow to select color/point shape/connections/antialiasing for curves


RECENTLY DONE
* add a separate tables to view raw ascii data and parsed data (doubles)
* add checks for transition points when reading from network to avoid
duplicates of transition points
